<h1 class = "mars">Climate Change: The Basics</h1>
<p>Weather records from across Canada show that every year since 1998—that’s 20 years ago now—has been warmer than the 20th century average. This means that a whole generation of Canadians has never experienced what most of modern history considered a “normal” Canadian climate.<br/>
<br/>

But it’s not just <strong>Canada</strong>, of course. The whole planet is getting warmer.</p>
<h2>Earth is heating up</h2>
   <div class="box">
    <p>Determining the average temperature of the entire planet is an amazing scientific achievement. The data used to calculate the average comes from a variety of sources. Air temperature is recorded around the world at weather stations and by weather balloons. Ocean temperatures are measured using thousands of buoys and ships. Orbiting satellites continually monitor the ocean and air temperatures all over the world.<a href="https://www.fairobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/climate-climate-change-news-global-warming-global-warming-news.jpg">Save Earth</a>
     Various independent international research organizations collect and carefully analyze these millions of measurements to determine the overall temperature of Earth. These records clearly show that Earth has been heating up for more than a century, and especially over the last 50 years. In fact, 17 of the 18 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.

This modern global warming is a sudden departure from the temperatures that have been typical for the past 10,000 years. And, unlike other climate changes that have occurred naturally throughout Earth’s long history, human activities are responsible.</p><br/>



<h3>The cause: human activity</h3>


<p>Our planet's climate is influenced by many natural factors, including the Earth's tilt, its orbit around the sun, large volcanic eruptions, and changing ocean currents. Because we know a lot about how these forces work, we also know that none of them explain the sudden, recent warming of the globe.<br/>

Evidence shows that only increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—specifically carbon dioxide concentrations—can explain Earth’s observed warming trend. Greenhouse gases are called that because they effectively act like a greenhouse or a layer of insulation for the Earth: they trap heat and warm the planet. (See our “Greenhouse Gases” page for more information.)<br/>

</p><div class="border">
<p >And there’s only one explanation for why carbon dioxide concentrations are on the rise: the combustion of fossil fuels by humans.<br/>

How do we know this? By examining carbon atoms, scientists can tell whether the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere came from fossil fuels. Research shows that the amount of carbon dioxide released by burning fuel has skyrocketed over the past couple of centuries, intensifying the greenhouse effect and warming the planet.

<h3>Risks and impacts</h3>
<p class="footer">We sometimes hear about global average temperatures changing by two or three degrees. This might sound trivial, but those small-sounding numbers can translate into massive real-world impacts.<a href="graph.jpg">Graph</a>
<br/>
    The climate determines almost everything about how we live, work, and play. We build our cities, factories, and highways to suit our climate. We are dependent on predictable weather patterns for our food supply. The plants, animals, and ecosystems of the world have adapted to climate conditions that are suddenly changing.<br/></p>

    <h4>Some of the projected and current effects of global warming in Canada include:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Melting permafrost, threatening northern buildings and transportation and releasing methane, which further accelerates global warming.</li>
<li>East and West coast sea level rise, threatening to flood cities, increase storm damage, and accelerate erosion.</li>
<li>Increased activity of pest and invasive species, posing risks to our ecosystems and our economy.</li>
<li class="hindi">More variable and more extreme weather, with increased risk of weather-related catastrophes such as droughts and floods.</li>
</ul>
