FILENAMES: Very important

Grouping/Nesting: use commas to group things together (comma is OR)
Nesting:   .x y {RULE;}:  (space is AND)

Dimensions: Height/Width, min- and max-; px and % can be used (% is as a % of the page) - Showcase Lab5.html example, adjust width/margin, say "width is 50% so the text gets squished and moves around."  Image moves because % is based on window size.  Min/max height scale unless a conflict occurs

Positioning: No more center tags!
Fixed: Handy for menu bars, logins.  Is always there in the same spot!
Absolute: Stays in a specific spot regardless of things moving around it.  Doesn't scroll with the page.
Relative: Any movement information you pass into this kind of positioning moves the content relative to its unadjusted position, i.e. left: 20px; is 20px away from where it normally would have shown up.  Handy for adjusting things on a small scale.
Location: Absolute/Fixed start at top-left corner, relative start in-place

Overlap: Z-index, higher index brings closer to screen

TWO COLUMN LAYOUT:
Centre-ing: margin: 0 auto; will create no margins top and bottom, and equate left and right (centre the box in its FIXED or ABSOLUTE parent)
FLOAT: Float and clear need to work together



TALK ABOUT PADDING AND MARGIN MODIFICATIONS FIRST

Exercise 1: Grab groupNest, group p1 and p3 together with OR along with p2 and p4 together with OR, nest p in div1 with AND
Exercise 2: Follow along and experiment
Exercise 3: Follow along and experiment
Exercise 4: SFW site any recommendations (otherwise I will pick http://www.thecompletetraveler.ca/)
